# PyDBSCAN
A simple DBScan Clustering Implementation

Please note, there are also plenty of very nice (i.e. more effective/efficient) DBScan implementations out here. This guy
is more of an exercise and something to be relatively clear and easy to read. If you use it, awesome!

A more crude version of it that was the basis of this was actually used in the published research, see the MASCOTS 2013 paper "Validating Storage System Instrumentation"
